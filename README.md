# ARIMA Time Series Forecasting

## With this demo you can have

This notebook focuses on time series forecasting of atmospheric CO₂ levels using the ARIMA model.

## Contents

* Data Exploration & Visualization
* Load and plot the CO₂ dataset to understand trends.
* Stationarity Checks
* ARIMA Model Building
* Experiment with different (p, d, q) parameters to select the best model.

## Model Diagnostics

Analyze residuals and generate diagnostic plots to validate assumptions.

## Forecasting
Forecast future CO₂ levels with confidence intervals using the trained ARIMA model.

## Dependencies

Python 3.10.x, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels

## Output

* Visualizations of historical and predicted CO₂ levels.
* Diagnostic plots for residuals, autocorrelation, and distribution checks.
* Forecast plots with confidence intervals.
